The choice of threshold for dg_cover.pl (-t) option is dependent on the sequencing coverage, amount of sequencing errors, and the desired number of rare variants to be incorporated in the graph. 
In summary, low values of threshold increases the complexity of the graph, but large values make the graph fragmented and affect the generation of full length paths from the graph. 

In order to address this, one can use the following scripts to filter and remove only the tips from the condensed graph

perl process_condensed.pl -f file1.cond.graph -k kmerfileStep2 -t 2 -ct 5 > file1.updated.cond.graph

This file uses two thresholds for now: 
1. -t : ignores all nodes with k-mer counts less than this number. (can be kept small 2-3)
2. -ct: ignores all tips in the graph with counts less than this value. (can be around 3 sigma less than the sequencing depth)

The updated condensed graph can now be used to generate paths from dg_cover_condensed.pl 

Usage:
time perl ../dg_cover_condensed.pl -cg file1.updated.cond.graph -nd file1.nodedepth -k kmerfileStep2 -t "Threshold" -f "M" -IS "InsertSize" -paired "PairedSetStep4" > outputfile.updated

where 	file1.updated.cond.graph is the updated condensed graph. 
	file1.nodedepth is an intermediate file generated by dg_cover.pl script, with the suffix "nodedepth"
	kmerfileStep2 is the kmerfile generated in Step2 
	M is the factor used in dg_cover.pl
	Insert size is the insert size used for sequencing of paired reads
	outputfile is the output of the file. 

The output file can be processed similar to the output of dg_cover.pl
